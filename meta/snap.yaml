description: |-
  HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP
  client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as
  human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that
  allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and
  natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be used
  for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.

  This version of httpie includes unix socket support, and in
  particular support for snapd:// URLs for ease of interaction with
  the snapd REST API.
